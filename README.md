We have implemented a socially connecting platform using data structure concepts to implement, features such as friend list management, pending friend requests, mutual friend suggestions, friend categories. We aim to allow users to manage their social interaction and receive personalized recommendations.

Features:
File management and storage system: Saving the C++ file streams to save the friendsâ€™ information to a file and load them when the program is restarted. Remembering who are the actual friends.
Linked List: Used for storing the core friend list.
Queue: Used for handling pending friend requests.
Stack: Used for blocked users and undo operations.
AVL Trees: Used for friendship levels and sorted retrieval.
Graphs: Used for mutual friend suggestions and friend connections.
Hash Maps: Used for categorization and interest-based recommendations.
Recursion: Used for solving tree traversal, tree-nodes deletion, merge sort.
Time Complexity Analysis: Seeing the efficiency of program.
